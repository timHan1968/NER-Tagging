# Named Entity Tagging
 
An NER tagging system that recognizes named entities, such as "Bostn" and "Google", in a given text file and lables them as one of the NER classes including "*location*", "*person*", "*organization*", and "*miscmiscellaneous*".

Includes three versions for comparison:

1. A simple rule-based Baseline model
2. A ML model using HMM (*Hidden Markov Model*)
3. A ML model using MEMM (*Maximum Entropy Markov Model*)
